# Messages page

The Messages page displays information about messages on your system in one of two views: 
- Tile view
- Context view

## Tile view

By default, the Messages page displays the Tile view.

In Tile view, the main part of the page is an array of tiles containing high-level information about messages from your system and the left column contains some controls for filtering the messages displayed.

You can filter the messages displayed as follows:
- By partner -- In the **Partners** field, enter a partner's name or ID to display only messages pertaining to that partner. You must enter the entire name or ID. 
- By message -- In the **Messages** field, enter a message ID to display the matching message. You must enter the entire message ID.
- By message type -- Select one or more message types to display just those message types. Deselect a message type to hide those messages. All messages are displayed when no message types are highlighted. 
- By date -- Select a date range to display messages that were sent in that range.

Each tile provides details about a single message.
